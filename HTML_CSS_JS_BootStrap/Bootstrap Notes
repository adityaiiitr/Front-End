Bootstrap 
=> it is a front end framework
=> the framework is made up of different libraries
=> these libraries are made up of css classes and javascript snippets
initially the developer was responsible for declaring the styles, examples
<p class="one"> Hello!</p>
.one{
    background-color:red;
}
team is it good idea for wasting the developer time on declaring the styles 
instead of working on the logic not on styles

now the answer for this was Bootstrap

Bootstrap: It is a framework with prdefined CSS classes and prdefined javascript snippets

=> Now we have 5th version of Bootstrap=> By using the bootsrap framework we can create responsive websites.
    =>the same code will be adopted to any screen size.
    =>watch,tab,tv,mobile phone,.....etc

Q. Before Bootsrap how to create reponsive websites...
=> Yes before this we had concept called CSS media queries. Which was used to define the code for different screen size.
ex: for 6 diff device you have to create 6 diff logic with screen size.

Q. Is there any similar framework like bootstrap?
=> Yes we do similar frameworks like bootstrap namely:
1.material UI
2.Tailwind CSS 
etc....

Bootstrap was the first and it is like a mother to all other frameworks.
