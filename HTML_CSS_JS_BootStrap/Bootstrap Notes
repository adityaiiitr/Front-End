Bootstrap 
=> it is a front end framework
=> the framework is made up of different libraries
=> these libraries are made up of css classes and javascript snippets
initially the developer was responsible for declaring the styles, examples
<p class="one"> Hello!</p>
.one{
    background-color:red;
}
team is it good idea for wasting the developer time on declaring the styles 
instead of working on the logic not on styles

now the answer for this was Bootstrap

Bootstrap: It is a framework with prdefined CSS classes and prdefined javascript snippets

=> Now we have 5th version of Bootstrap=> By using the bootsrap framework we can create responsive websites.
    =>the same code will be adopted to any screen size.
    =>watch,tab,tv,mobile phone,.....etc

Q. Before Bootsrap how to create reponsive websites...
=> Yes before this we had concept called CSS media queries. Which was used to define the code for different screen size.
ex: for 6 diff device you have to create 6 diff logic with screen size.

Q. Is there any similar framework like bootstrap?
=> Yes we do similar frameworks like bootstrap namely:
1.material UI
2.Tailwind CSS 
etc....

Bootstrap was the first and it is like a mother to all other frameworks.

Concepts to be covered 

    what?
    => BS is Front end Framework which is made up of HTML CSS and JavaScript.
    => It Helps us in building responsive website.
    => Responsive websites - A website getting autoatically adjusted based on the screen size in which you are accessing the webpages
        ex: watch ,mobile TV laptop desktop etc.

    why?
    => 6 different devices are present .... if BS is not there then we have to build 6 different css files for differenrt screen size  
    => Because of Various readymade snippets available.

    How to implement bootstrap in html document 
    => Remember BS is nothing but it is has predefined css properties & JS Code.
    => To invoke .....


    Containers
    => It is used to hold something together.
    
    container class - similar to 80% width and left and right 10% space in left as it is.

    container fluid - it is 100% width is occupied.

        container class => Space at the left and right
        container-fluid class => No space at left and right

    Grid System/Layout 
    => This concept is very important beacuse the responsive depends on this grid.

    1 row - 1 column => col-12
    1 row - 3 column => col-4
    1 row - 6 column => col-3
    

    for ex: 
    Laptop - 12 columns, 1 row
    Tab - 6 columns, 1 row but it gets 
        adjusted automatically into 2 rows
    Moble - 3 columns 1 Row but it gets     automatically into 4 row
    Watch -  1 column 1 row but it gets adjusted automatically into 12 rows.

    Typography

        h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6
        in h1 tag we learnt a new class called as display-1, display-2 .... display-6

        <h1 class="display-1">Hello</h1>

        p, a, mark, del, ins, b, i, strong, etc.


    Colors
        for adding colours to text i.e content => text-primary => blue
        success(green), warning(orange), dark, light, info, secondary, grey etc...

        for adding background colour to the background => bg-primary, bg-success

        Text
        => text-success, text-warning
            <div>
            <p class="bg-primary">Hello!</p>
            <p class="text-primary">Hello!</p>

        rounded-circle
        img-thumbnail 
        

    placement of images - float-start, float-end

            justify-content-start => left =deafult
            justify-content-centre => centre
            justify-conent-end => right
    => If you need space betwwen pagination using padding concept class="p-2"

    Progress Bar
    => class="progress progress-bar" class="progress-bar" in another div this need style width 
    => we will use the style attribute to mention the progress using the width property

    cards

        card
        card-body

        carousel-control-prev
        carousel-control-next

                JavaScript
        data-bs-target - It is a attribute. This attribute will match the given id to the elements which has the class carousel

            dropdown-menu
            dropdown-item
            dropdown-toggle => arrow symbols

        dropdown-bs-toggle => It is a attribute. It is used to pick the items and display them below as a dropdown

    navbar 
    => It is a menu

    mb -margin bottom == mb-10 means margin bottom 10px
    me - margin east(right)
    mt - margin top
