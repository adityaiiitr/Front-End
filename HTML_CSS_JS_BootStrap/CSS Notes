CSS - Cascading Style Sheet
<style>

What?
 - It is used to describe how the HTML elements will look like.
 - It is used to manipulate the properties of the HTML elements.
 - It is used to implement style on HTML elements.

How to Implement CSS?
 - It can be implemented in 3 different approaches namely:
   a. Inline CSS
      - The style for the HTML elements is implemented in the opening tag of the HTML elements itself.
      - By using the style attribute we Implement the inline css.
      - It will also be in the form of "property_name:vale"
      - if you have multiple properties then each propert should be separated by a ";"
   b. Internal CSS
      - The Style is implemented in inside the head tag as a content. 
      - we use the style tag for implementing the internal css
   c. External CSS
      - The style for the HTML Element is implemented outside the HTML Document in a separated style sheet.
      - a separate sheet with .css extension should be created.
      - We use the link tag inside the head tag to connect the external style sheet with our HTML document
Selectors
  - These are used to select or find the HTML Elements from the document and implementthe css styles.
        Element Selector - By using the HTML Element itself.
        ID Selector - by defining a id attribute in html Element.
        Class Selector - By defining a class attribute in the html elements.
        Universal Selector - By using the * we can implement the properties for all the elements within the html document
        child Selector - By using the space
        Group Selector - by using the comma

Comments in CSS
    /* Your Comments HERE */

Box Model - Margin,Border, Padding
    => Every HTML Elementhas 3 different layers surrounding it.
    => Top to bottom and left to right:
    Margin-->Border-->Padding-->CONTENT<--Padding<--Border<--Margin
    
    Shorthand
      margin: top right bottom left;
      border-width: top right bottom left;
      padding: top right bottom left;

      border-width/border-style/border-color Shorthand
      border: width style color;
         border: 1px solid red;

CSS Dimensions
=> width - x axis - It is always fixed
=> height - y axix - is unlimited

for specifying the dimensions you can use different units:-
px
%
cm
mm
em
etc.....

width: 50px .......values or inherit(It will inherit from its parent tag)

      inherit example
      body tag - width is 50 px
         para tag - width as inherit since the parent tag i.e body tag it will inherit the width as 50px

Font-Style
=> This is basically on the content level
=> by default the browser uses Times New Roman as font family. Now you can chamge this using this property.
   font-style  -  Make the text bend a little bit or making it in terms of italic 
   ex: italic and oblique
   font-size - sizee of content. again it uses px,cm,mm,em,%, etc...
   Ex: 10px, 1em etc... 
   font-weight - to implement the bold property
   Ex: bold, bolder, thin, etc...

Background
=> background-color  -   
=> background-image  - background-image: url(location);
=> backgroud-repeat  -   => your screen is 1000x1000
         and image is 100x100 
         In your screen how many image can we provide
            in x-axis 10 images
            in y-axis 10 images in total you will have 100 images 
         this is not a good UX
         we use background repeat to handle the repeatation of the image.
=> background-size  -  100%

   Shorthand property
   background: color image_location repeat;

Display
=> It deals with ho wto display the element'=> 2  types of values are present
   block Create a separate block -  display: block;
   inline on same line - display: inline;
   none - hides the tag elements - display: block;

id v/s class
=> The class starts with .classname and id starts with #idname
=>you can pass multiple classes to a single HTML Elements 
ex class='one two three'
you can pass only one id to a single HTML Elements 
ex id='one'

position 
=> It is used to specify positio n of a HTML Elements
      static - default position that you came across when you create a HTML Documents
      relative - The HTML elements position is decided by where it is placed in the HTML Document. This is normal
      absolute - The HTML elements position is decided on its parent tag or ancestor tag


 few more:---
      fixed
      sticky

float: right/left;
give width %percentage so that it adds upto 100% and it goes clockwise
