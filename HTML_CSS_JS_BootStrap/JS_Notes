Javascript
    => It is a Object Oriented Language
    => This language ius used to build dynamic web pages
    => we can change the behaviour of web pages
    => The current newly launched javascript version is Javascript version 9
    But majority everyone are using JS VErsion 6 (2015)

why?
    => Since this language can be used in both front end and back end to build complex dynamic web application.
    => It is simple and easy to learn
    => since it is object oriented we can use this language to build complex dynamic web application 
    => open source - n number of libraries written in js that you can use to build your web application 

Features
    => validation of user input
    => handle errors
    => resuse of the code 
    => object oriented language

Differnt approaches To implement JS -
    Internal - Inside Body tag
    Internal - Inside Head Tag
    Internal - Inside HTML Tag
    External - Separate Script File with The extension .js

    => Best Practice is to add JS in body before closing tag nad the worst practice is to add it in html tag

href is used to connect to a data file (hence 2 files)
src embeds the data file to current file (hence single file)

Comments
    => // This part is commented

        // Single Line Comments

        /* Multi
         Line Comments */ 

Variables
    =>It is  a name given to a memory location
    => This memory location is used for storing the data

    NAming Convention
        - Name should not start with a number
        - name should always start with a ltter $ or _ 
        - You can use the combination of number, letter, _ and $
        - Variables are case sensitive 
                x
                 is not same as X

    How to declare a variable 
    - using the 'var' keywor
    - using the 'let' keyword
    - using the 'const' keyword

        Syntax: 
            var Variable_Name = Value;

        var
            => It is used to declare a global variable
            => It is old so works in old browser

        let 
            => It is used to declare a gloabal as well as locat variable
            => In 2015, this was introduced

        const
            => It is also global or local
            => In 2015, this was introduced

        Examples: 

        const a =10;
        a=15; //error

        var a=10; //Number datatype
        a="String" // changed data type and value

From ES 6 It is not mandatory to add ; to define the end of statement. The compiler is smart enough to differentiate the end of line. It can also understand what type of data variable has
