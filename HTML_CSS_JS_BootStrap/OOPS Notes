OOPS Concept

=> Before OOPS we had procedure oriented programming language or structural programming language.
        In these pops we were able to represent a very simple data.
        These lang had very less features.
        This lang had some disadvantage such as could not represent the real problem faced by people.

=> OOP language
    -> More Feature Lang
    -> Represent Real Problems and we were able to get the solutions for the real problems that we were facing.

=> Terminologies
    -> Objects- its real world entity
            ex Laptop chair Desk Desk-Lamp etc
       Each object will have its own properties (variable/object/array) and it has methods(These are representation of the behaviour of the object)

    -> Class - collection of objectsproperties and its  methods. It is a wrapper or it is a container or a class is a blueprint or a template of an object which will hold the properties or methods

#Every class can have multiple objects

Inheritance - Reusable

Polymorphism - Doing the same task in different ways
        overloading
        overRiding

Abstraction - Hiding the Internal Functionality from the users view

Encapsulation - This is a wrapperor container or binding the code together into a single unit

Constructor 
    This is a method.
    it is triggered when a object for a class is created.
    it will allocate the properties and the methods of the class to the object.

Super method => it is a method which will invoke        the            parent class constructor
    this method can also be used to carry the data from the child class to the parent class

this keyword
    it is a reference. it refers to the object within the scope.
    usually we use this keyword to refer a global object within a class

ES5 Concepts
    => It is Javascript Version 5.
    => They introdused many methods for arrays
        such as map,filter,reduce,foreach,ETC
    => Handling of JSON Data
        parse and stringify

JSON
=> Javascript object Notation
=> It is a data format
=> it is used to store the data 
=> it is used to transport data from one end to another end
=>  you can also manage the data using JSON
=> It is similar to javascript objecrt but some difference are there

    1. The key in json is enclosed in ' or "
    2. the key value pair is enclosed in {}
    3. Every key value pair is separated by ,
    4. The key value is separated by a :

    {
        "key :"value , .....
    }

    parse 
    => It will convert the JSON object into Javascript Object

    stringify
    => It will convert JSON object into a string


ES6 Concepts
    => It is Javascript Version 6.
    => keyword : let and const was introduced
    => Arrow Functions
    => Promises
    => Map Object & Set Object
    => They introduced many methods for arrays and strings
        find(), etc..... String.startswith(), String.endswith(),etc....


Arrow Function
    => It is a shorthand property to define a function
    => Certain condition needs to be followed 
    1. No need to use the function keyword
    2. if you have only one argument then no need to use/enclose it with () braces
    3. No need to use the statement within the {} braces
    4. In arrow function no need to use return keyword
    5. The func_name will be defined as a variable and the function definition will be stored as a value inside the variable
    6. we should use the => b/w the argument and the statement


    function abc(a){
        console.log(a)
    }

    abc = a => console.log(a)


    function abc(a,b){
        return a+b
    }

    abc = (a,b) => a+b 

     function abc(a,b){
        console.log(a)
        console.log(b)
        return a+b
    }

    abc=(a,b)=>{
        console.log(a)
        console.log(b)
        return a+b
    }

    a=()=>{}

    a is the function name
    () => {} the function definition
    Use a to call the function

   
    Callback Functions
    => When wer pass a function as a argument to another function
        ex
        let b = a.map(myFunction)
        function myFunction(item) { 
        return item * 5
        }

    Callback Chaining
    => You have Multiple Callback within another callback......

    Callback Hell

    Promise

    Promise Chaining

    async and await

    keyword
